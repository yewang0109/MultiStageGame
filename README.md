Code for the paper The evolution of cooperation: multi-stage interactions, synergy effects, and population structures

Each folder is used to reproduce the corresponding results in the main text

All codes are written by MathWorks Matlab R2022b

To run the code, make sure that all files are in the same folder

This code is an example to show the evolutionary dynamics in the multi-stage game. To reproduce our results with other parameters, you only need to change the values of the parameters accordingly.

For other population structures, you can use files in the folder Other_Population_Structure to generate corresponding networks.
